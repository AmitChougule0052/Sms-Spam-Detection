# Sms-Spam-Detection
 SMS - Spam - Detection Project

## Content : 

     This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect spam messages from legitimate (ham) ones in SMS communication. The goal is to classify incoming messages as either Spam or Ham, helping to 
     reduce unwanted or malicious content.

## Overview : 

   •  Project Type: Classification (Natural Language Processing)
   •   Algorithm Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes
   •   Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn 

## Key Features : 

  •  Text preprocessing using NLTK (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
  •   Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
  •   Model training and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
  •   Visual insights into message length, word count, and class distribution    

## Steps Involved : 

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Text Vectorization
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation

## Results : 

 Achived the high accuracy and precision in spam classification. 
 Efficient model sutaible for real time implementation in communication system .
